For my project I solicited feedback from Daphne Le Seur and Aleena Eskeets. Since I was dealing with a very noisy data set, I asked what other variables 
I could include in my data set to help isolate the effect of environmental factors. Daphne said, "it would also be interesting to note how many parking enforcement 
employees there were during each of these months. I'm not sure if there is public data on that, but it looks like during the summer months is where the citations 
goes down. I think this can be for sure attributed to fewer students on campus during these months but could potentially also be affected by a smaller number of 
officers patrolling during the summer." Daphne had a point with this, and she's right. However, given that this data wasn't publicly available and given that it was
difficult to obtain that data from the university (I did reach out), I assumed that this covariate could be explained by changes in season.

I recognized that my research question may be hard to answer. Daphne said she'd be curious to see how citations are correlated with precipitation and focus in isolating a causal effect of
precipitation on the daily number of traffic citations.

Leena said similar things, although she said she'd interested in how revenue (the amount of daily/weekly) obtained from traffic citations flowed over time.
Could we prove that university parking police engage in biweekly or monthly quotas? I decided to investigate this question in my exploratory data analysis.

For my main project I decided to see if any weather or environmental factor had a significant effect on the number of daily number of traffic citations all other things
accounted for. This included for controlling for interaction effects between the seasons and months and the different environmental terms.
